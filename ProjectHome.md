# About #

When I started using OS X in 2005 the one thing I missed most was Minesweeper. Because I lacked Minesweeper, I found myself unusually productive. In order to solve this problem, I decided it would be a good idea to teach myself [Cocoa](http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/) and [Objective-C](http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Introduction/introObjectiveC.html) and write MacSweeper.

MacSweeper is **free software**. The source code available through [SVN](http://code.google.com/p/macsweeper/source/checkout), and you can even [browse it online](http://code.google.com/p/macsweeper/source/browse/trunk) through the wonders of Google. It is not the prettiest code, but it does provide a number of useful pointers on how to start developing a simple yet complete application in OS X.

I claim no responsibility for anything this program does to your computer, but it should not be capabable of doing any harm. It will save your user preferences in the file **`org.conbere.MacSweeper.plist`** in your user defaults directory (usually **`~/Library/Preferences/`**).

# Screenshots #

No application is complete without screenshots, so here you go:
