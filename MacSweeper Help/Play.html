            <p>Playing MacSweeper is identical to playing Microsoft's Minesweeper.  If you are familiar with Minesweeper, there is nothing new to learn.</p>
            <p>If you are unfamiliar with Minesweeper, the game is not difficult to play.</p>
            <p>On the game board there are some number of mines hidden underneath the cells on the board.  The objective is simple: you must reveal every cell that <strong>does not contain a mine</strong>.<p>
            <p>Start the game by clicking on one of the cells.  Do not worry, your first move can never lose the game.  The cell you reveal will either be blank or contain a number "1" through "8".  The number represents the number of mines
            that surround that particular cell.  That is, if the number is "2" the cell has exactly 2 mines in the adjacent cells surrounding it.  Adjacent cells are any of the 8 surrounding cells.  If a cell revealed is blank it means that there
            are no mines adjacent to it.  MacSweeper will automatically clear cells surrounding blank cells for you.</p> 
            <p>The game is won once you have revealed all of the cells that do not contain mines.  At this point the timer will stop and you can find out how well you did.  High scores are tracked by the game, and you may be asked to enter your name
            to be kept in the high scores list.<p>
