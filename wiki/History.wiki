#summary The history of the MacSweeper project

= Introduction =

!MacSweeper was written by Morgan Conbere during the summer of 2007. At the time it was born out of frustration with the existing Minesweeper applications that existed for the platform, and the desire to learn more about Cocoa and Objective-C.


= Details =

The original project was hosted at http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~mconbere/macsweeper/. The first version was released in June 2007, and it was updated with additional features and refinements over time.
