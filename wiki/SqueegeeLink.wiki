#summary Provides a link to the Squeegee update feed

= Introduction =

I am working on a Project called Squeegee that will provide automatic installation and downloads of OS X software. It is a simple technology based off of parsing a standard Atom XML feed with some special syntax to indicate information about the software.

As a developer, all you have to do is publish an Atom feed. It's simple and easy. The user software will do the rest.
